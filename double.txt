The double in C is a data type that is used to store high-precision floating-point data or numbers (up to 15 to 17 digits). It is used to store large values of decimal numbers.
Values that are stored are double the size of data that can be stored in the float data type. Thus it is named a double data type.
Any variable declared using the double data type in C is of the size 8 bytes (or 64 bits).

Syntax for Declaration
double varName;


EXAMPLE:
double temp1 = 98.4;
double temp2;
double temp3;
temp3 = 97.88;

printf("Value of temp1 = %lf\n",temp1);
printf("Value of temp2 = %f\n",temp2);
printf("Value of temp3 = %f\n",temp3);

Output :

Value of temp1 = 98.400000
Value of temp2 = 0.000000
Value of temp3 = 97.880000
