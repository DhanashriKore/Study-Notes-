A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a loop that needs to execute a specific number of times.
How does for loop work in C?
The init step is executed first, and only once. This step allows you to declare and initialize any loop control variables. ...Next, the condition is evaluated. ...
After the body of the 'for' loop executes, the flow of control jumps back up to the increment statement. .
The condition is now evaluated again.

Syntax
for ( init; condition; increment ) {
   statement(s);
}

EXAMPLE:
#include <stdio.h>
 int main () 
{
   int a;
   for( a = 10; a < 20; a = a + 1 )
{
      printf("%d\t", a);
  }
  return 0;
}

OUTPUT:
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
