                                                                                                               VOID  KEYWORD

In C, if you donâ€™t specify the parameters of a function, it can accept any number of parameters of any type. If you come from another programming language, this could be confusing at first. The way to define a function, that does not accept parameters in C is to use the keyword void as the only element in the parameters list. 
When declaring functions, you will decide whether that function would be returning a value or not. If that function will not return a value, such as when the purpose of a function is to display some outputs on the screen, then "void" is to be placed at the leftmost part of the function header. When a return value is expected after the function execution, the data type of the return value is placed instead of "void".


EXAMPLE:
 void doit( const int & x )
        {
            x = 5; // ILLEGAL
        }
        int main()
        {
          int z = 27;
          doit( z );
          printf("z is now %d\n", z);

          return 0;
        }
