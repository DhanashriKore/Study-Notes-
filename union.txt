                                                   UNION KEYWORD
the "union" keyword is used to define a user-defined data type that can hold multiple different data types at the same memory location. A union is similar to a structure, but it only stores one value at a time, regardless of its type.Unions can be useful when working with data that can have different types, but only one value is needed at a time. They can also be used to save memory, as the memory allocated for the union is only as large as the largest member.

 Syntax
union union_name {
    data_type1 member_name1;
    data_type2 member_name2;
    ...
};

EXAMPLE:
#include <stdio.h>

union my_union {
    int x;
    float y;
    char c;
};
int main() {
    union my_union u;
    u.x = 10;
    printf("Value of u.x: %d\n", u.x);
    u.y = 3.14;
    printf("Value of u.y: %f\n", u.y);
    u.c = 'A';
    printf("Value of u.c: %c\n", u.c);
    return 0;
}
