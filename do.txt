                                              DO  KEYWORD
The do keyword is used as part of the do-while loop construct.
The do-while loop is a type of loop that executes a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. 

The syntax for the do-while loop is as follows:
do {
    // block of code to be executed
} while (condition);

EXAMPLE:
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int i = 1;
    do {
        printf("%d ", i);
        i++;
    } while (i <= 10);
    return 0;
}

output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
