                                                                                        UNSIGNED KEYWORD
The unsigned keyword is a data type specifier, that makes a variable only represent non-negative integer numbers (positive numbers and zero). It can be applied only to the char , short , int and long types.
This is implemented for fetching values from the address of a variable having an unsigned decimal integer stored in memory. An unsigned Integer means the variable can hold only a positive value. This format specifier is used within the printf() function for printing the unsigned integer variables.

Syntax:

printf(“%u”, variable_name);
or
printf(“%u”, value);

EXAMPLE:
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    // Print value 20 using %u
    printf("%u\n", 20);
    return 0;
}


Output:

20
