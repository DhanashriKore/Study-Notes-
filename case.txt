CASE is a complex function that has two forms; the simple-when form and the searched-when form. In either form CASE returns a result, the value of which controls the path of subsequent processing.
The CASE function must have at least one WHEN clause. The ELSE expression is optional. The default ELSE expression is NULL. A CASE expression is delimited by END. The test values do not have to be literal values.
The searched-when form is similar, but has the additional flexibility of allowing a number of different values to be test.

EXAMPLE:
int a = 9;
switch (a) 
{
 case 1: printf("I am One\n");
         break;
 case 2: printf("I am Two\n");
         break;

 case 9: printf("I am Nine\n");
 case 0: printf("I am Zero\n");
 default: printf("I am default\n");
}

Output â€“
The output of this switch is :
I am Nine
I am Zero
I am default
