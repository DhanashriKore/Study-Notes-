Enumeration or Enum in C is a special kind of data type defined by the user. It consists of constant integrals or integers that are given names by a user. The use of enum in C to name the integer values makes the entire program easy to learn, understand, and maintain by the same or even different programmer.
An enum is defined by using the ‘enum’ keyword in C, and the use of a comma separates the constants within.

SYNTAX:
enum enum_name{int_const1, int_const2, int_const3, …. int_constN};


EXAMPLE:
#include <stdio.h>  
 enum days{Sunday=1, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday};  
int main()
{
    for(int i=Sunday;i<=Saturday;i++){
        printf("%d, ",i);
 }
    return 0;
}

Output:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7
