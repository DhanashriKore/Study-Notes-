                                                      GOTO  KEYWORD
The "goto" keyword in C programming is used to transfer control of the program to a labeled statement elsewhere in the program. It is generally considered to be a dangerous construct and its use is discouraged, as it can make the code difficult to read and maintain.

Here is the syntax for the "goto" statement inC:
goto label;

EXAMPLE:
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int num = 10;

    if (num > 0) {
        goto positive;
    }
   printf("%d is not a positive number\n", num);
   return 0;
positive:
    printf("%d is a positive number\n", num);
  return 0;
}
OUTPUT:
10 is a positive number
//This is because the "if" statement is true, so the program jumps to the labeled statement positive: and executes the code within the curly braces.
