                                                                          STRUCT KEYWORD
Struct is the keyword used to define structure in C.
The structure in C is a user-defined datatype, that is used to store different data type variables under one user-defined data type.
The Structure variables are used to access the members of the structure.
The size of the structure variable will be the same as the sum of the size of different data types members of the structure.
To initialize the variables, we need to use the structure variable name then a '.' dot and after that the name of the member that we want to initialize.

Syntax :
struct structure_name
{
    data_type member1;
    data_type member2;
};

EXAMPLE:
#include<stdio.h>
struct demo_structure
{
   int a, b;
   char c;
};
int main(){
   struct demo_structure var;
   var.a=7;
   var.b=9;
   var.c='A';
  printf("%d %d %c", var.a, var.b,var.c);
   return 0;
}

OUTPUT:
7 9 A
