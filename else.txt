                                                                                                                  ELSE  KEYWORD
Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true. Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false. Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.
If the Boolean expression evaluates to true, then the if block will be executed, otherwise, the else block will be executed. C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.

Syntax
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}

EXAMPLE:
int time = 20;
if (time < 18) {
  printf("Good day.");
} else {
  printf("Good evening.");
}

 Outputs:
 "Good evening."
