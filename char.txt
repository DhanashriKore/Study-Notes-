The "char" keyword is used to define a character variable. A character variable can hold a single character, which can be a letter, digit, symbol, or whitespace.It's important to note that in C programming, characters are represented using the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) code. Each character has a corresponding ASCII code, which is a unique integer value between 0 and 127. The ASCII code for uppercase letters 'A' to 'Z' is 65 to 90, and for lowercase letters 'a' to 'z' is 97 to 122. 

SYNTAX:
char variable_name;

EXAMPLE:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char c1 = 'A';
    char c2 = 66;
    char c3 = '\n';

    printf("c1 = %c\n", c1);
    printf("c2 = %c\n", c2);
    printf("c3 = %c", c3);

    return 0;
