                                                                             WHILE  KEYWORD
 The "while" keyword is used to create a loop that executes as long as a certain condition is true. The "while" keyword is commonly used to implement iteration in C programming. It's important to make sure that the condition in the "while" loop eventually becomes false, or else the loop will continue indefinitely, resulting in an infinite loop.

SYNTAX:
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed repeatedly
}

EXAMPLE:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 0;

    while (i < 10) {
        printf("%d ", i);
        i++;
    }

    return 0;
}
